JQuery plugin to make a button or link look like a speech-bubble with a TRANSPARENT background

This is the jQuery wrapper of this project: https://github.com/NicolasBrondin/html-speech-bubble

## Demo

This is what the bubble looks like (with a gradient background so you can see the bubble is transparent)

## How to

To implement this plugin in your project, simply add a link to this css file, and create an html element like the one in the demo.html file.
